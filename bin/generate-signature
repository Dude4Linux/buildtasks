Two steps are required to cryptographically verify image integrity.

1. By verifying the integrity of this signature file, you can be sure that
   the checksums included in this file are valid.

    $ gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xA16EB94D
    $ gpg --list-keys 0xA16EB94D
      pub   2048R/A16EB94D 2008-08-15 [expires: 2023-08-12]
      uid   Turnkey Linux Release Key <release@turnkeylinux.com>

    $ gpg --verify $(basename $filepath).sig
      gpg: Good signature from "Turnkey Linux Release Key"

2. By calculating the image checksum and validating the hashed value is the
   same as listed below, you can be sure the image was not corrupted in
   transit or tampered with.

    $ md5sum $(basename $filepath)
      $MD5SUM

    $ sha1sum $(basename $filepath)
      $SHA1SUM

    $ sha512sum $(basename $filepath)
      $SHA512SUM
