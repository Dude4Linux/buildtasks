To ensure the image has not been corrupted in transmit or tampered with,
perform the following two steps to cryptographically verify image integrity:

1. Verify the authenticity of this file by checking that it is signed with our
   GPG release key::

    $ gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xA16EB94D
    $ gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint 0xA16EB94D
      pub   2048R/A16EB94D 2008-08-15 [expires: 2023-08-12]
            Key fingerprint = 694C FF26 795A 29BA E07B  4EB5 85C2 5E95 A16E B94D
      uid   Turnkey Linux Release Key <release@turnkeylinux.com>

    $ gpg --verify $filename.hash
      gpg: Signature made using RSA key ID A16EB94D
      gpg: Good signature from "Turnkey Linux Release Key <release@turnkeylinux.com>"

2. Recalculate the image hash and make sure it matches your choice of hash below.

    $ sha256sum $filename
      $SHA256SUM

    $ sha512sum $filename
      $SHA512SUM

   Note, you can compare hashes automatically::

    $ sha256sum -c $filename.hash
      $filename: OK

    $ sha512sum -c $filename.hash
      $filename: OK

EOF
